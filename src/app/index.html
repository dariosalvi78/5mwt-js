            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <section>
                <p>The test consists in walking 3 times over a distance of 5 meters.</p>
                <p>
                    Select a straight path in your home such as a corridor.
                    The path should be well-lit, unobstructed and flat.
                    Mark two points at a measured distance of 5 meters (possibly mark them as lines).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Position your feet behind and just touching the 0-meter start point.
                    Press the "Start" button and follow the instructions on the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will be prompter to wait for 5 seconds, during which you should be as still as possible.
                    At the end of the 5 seconds start walking at your comfortable pace until the 5-meter mark.
                    Try not to start to slow down before the 5-meter mark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as you pass the 5-meter mark, press the "Done" button.
                    Following the instructions on the screen, turn around and repeat the test by pressing the "Start"
                    button again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The test must be repeated 3 times.
                    Allow sufficient time for recuperation between trials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may use a walking aid (cane, walker).
                    If you are receiving an IV drip, ask your doctor if you can perform the test without the IV without
                    any potential risk.
                    If not, then you should perform the test pushing the IV pole.
